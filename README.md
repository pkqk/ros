# It's marginally alive

Following along with the posts at
[Writing an OS in Rust](http://os.phil-opp.com).

Currently it's the first blog post that prints a
green OK to the screen. I've set up all the required
programs in a docker image so you can just run

    $ docker-compose run shell
    $ make

And then I've been running the `build/ros.iso` in
VirtualBox.
